# Spring 2024 Experiments

The first section will be used to keep track of any articles/papers that we want to reference during the semester. 
The current end goal is to have an implementation of Neural Sheaf Diffusion and then discuss possible extensions into the temporal domain if time persists. 

The second section will contain articles relevant to programming resources.
