# Spring 2024 TODO List

We will use this TODO file to keep track of any tasks that we need to do and share during meetings if we need help/resources with anything.

### TODO 

For Wednesday 1/29:
- [ ] Implement an MLP for the MNIST dataset
- [ ] Prepare a code review of the dataset to discuss in the next meeting.
    - Easiest way to do this is include comments in your code 
    to help you remember what a certain part does. 

Further down:
- [ ] Read about CNNs
- [ ] Implement a CNN in pytorch for the MNIST dataset.

- [ ] Play with some graphs using the Networkx package in python.
    - Build a graph from an edge list, compute the adjacency matrix, graph laplacian, and normalized graph laplacian.
- [ ] Download one of the graph datasets in the NSD paper (talk to Marco about this).

- [ ] Implement a basic GNN for node classification
- [ ] Read about Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN)
- [ ] Implement a GCN

- [ ] Read the Neural Sheaf Diffusion paper


### In Progress
- [ ] Request an account for the clusters in the math department

### Completed

- [x] Create Github repo and add Marco.
- [x] Read the GNNs article
- [x] Read about MLPs
